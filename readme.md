# Advent of Code 2022
https://adventofcode.com/2022

## Goals
- write some code during my sabattical
- brush the cobwebs off my ruby (and possibly other languages)

## Approach
- I'm prioritizing simple correct solutions over optimal ones. Input sizes have been very small so far. 

## Notes
- As of day 4 I switched to using file paths relative to repo root
